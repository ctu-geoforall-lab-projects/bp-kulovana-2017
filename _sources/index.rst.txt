Radiation Reconnaissance Results QGIS Plugin's Documentation
============================================================

.. warning:: This documentation corresponds to bachelor thesis "Zásuvný
   modul QGIS pro terénní radiační průzkum" (`PDF
   <https://github.com/ctu-geoforall-lab-projects/bp-kulovana-2017/raw/master/text/tereza-kulovana-bp-2017.pdf>`__). Up-to-date
   documentation is available at
   https://ctu-geoforall-lab.github.io/qgis-radiation-reconnaissance-results-plugin/.

This plugin generates predefined isolines from interpolated grid of dose rate 
or surface activity and it converts them to simplified polygons. Main output 
is a text report with coordinates in a MGRS system using format specified by 
APP-11 NATO Message Catalogue.


This plugin was created for Army of the Czech Republic (`ACR 
<http://www.army.cz/en/>`__).
